<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>With over 15 years of software engineering experience, I have been able to focus on learning as much about agile web develelopment, specializing in technologies such as <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>, <strong>Grails</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>front-end development</strong>. I <em>LOVE</em> TDD and testing as well.</p>

<p>I was a co-founder of ShareAPhoto, Ltd which was <a href="http://h20338.www2.hp.com/enterprise/cache/504712-0-0-225-121.html">acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2006</a>. I was the author of <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596520717.do">Rails Pocket Reference (published 2008 – O’Reilly)</a>. I spear-headed <a href="http://teachmetocode.com/">TeachMeToCode.com</a>, a popular on-demand screencasting website dedicated to helping others learn how to program, which includes a popular series on <a href="http://teachmetocode.com/screencasts/creating-a-twitter-clone-in-rails-part-1/">writing a Twitter clone with Rails</a>.</p>

<p>I designed and developed enterprise solutions such as <a href="http://www.reservationcounter.com/">Reservation Counter</a>, an online hotel booking engine, and <a href="http://www.cropcholate.com">Crop Chocolate</a>, a &#8216;deal of the day&#8217; site which is focused on scrapbooking supplies. I also dabbled in mobile development for iOS, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Berry+Mobile">Android</a> and <a href="https://developer.palm.com/appredirect/?packageid=com.berry.wendywwpro">Palm</a>.</p>

<p>I am an avid <a href="https://github.com/cavneb">contributor</a> to open source software. I enjoyed spending time working alongside the creators of the <a href="http://grails.org">Grails</a> framework with the <a href="http://grails.org/news/1285414">redesign and implementation</a> of the Grails.org website. This includes parts which cannot be seen, such as the backend admin/approval system.</p>

<h3>Portfolio (just a few of them)</h3>

<p><a href="http://apps.facebook.com/hooplasoft_giveaways/board">Facebook Sweepstakes</a> is a Facebook application that has become a pet project. It is a community of &#8216;sweekstalkers&#8217; who enter giveaway after giveaway. I built the software in Rails/MySQL. There are currently over 70,000 unique monthly users to date.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reservationcounter.com">Reservation Counter</a> is a low-fare hotel reservation application which ties in with the Expedia.com affiliate interface. I assisted in the design and built it with Rails/MySQL.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cropchocolate.com">Crop Chocolate</a> is a &#8216;deal of the day&#8217; website for the scrapbooker. This application includes a full cart system with checkout, merchant account integration, logistics integration, extensive reporting and much more. I was provided the photoshop artwork and built the site front and back with Rails/MySQL.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flobridge.com">FloBridge</a> is a direct lender for short-term payday loans that needed a site for developing its own leads. If the lead does not qualify via FloBridge, they are re-sold to a buyer tree. I wrote this using Rails/MySQL.</p>

<h3>Kudos</h3>

<p>
  Working with Eric was like watching a genius at work. He is one of the most talented developers I have ever seen. He is great at putting his head down and cranking out amazing code. I often compare watching him work to watching Picasso or Van Gogh painting. His code is beautiful. He takes time to make sure his it is clean and elegant. Without hesitation I would recommend him to anyone.

</p>




<p>
  I was referred to Eric by a another Web development company because of their expertise. I presented our challenge to him and within weeks hehad the right solution built. Since our initial deployment, Eric has quickly and cleanly developed further product that have been a huge asset to our company.
  <cite>- Jon Nelson, CropChocolate.com</cite>
</p>




<p>
  Eric is amazing! He has been able to accomplish programming tasks in hours that previously took our company months - literally. He has the rare combination of know-how and the drive to finish projects completely. He remains focused and understands priorities. He is able to share his insights without changing or challenging the task at hand. I highly recommend him in every way (as long as he never stops working with us!).
  <cite>- Ryan Williams, PartnerFusion.com</cite>
</p>




<p>
  Eric is a development powerhouse. He has a rare blend of core strengths in both halves of his brain. He possesses great creativity and design savvy as well as stellar programming ability. I know that any firm could be successful if it could fill itself with guys like Eric.
  <cite>- Chad Jardine, FloBridge.com</cite>
</p>




<p>
  If we wanted something done right, we went to Eric. His depth of experience allowed us to choose the best solution to any issue. His ability to get things done was a huge asset to the sales team.
