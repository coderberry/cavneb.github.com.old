<p>Eric has designed and developed enterprise solutions such as <a href="http://www.reservationcounter.com/">Reservation Counter</a>, an online hotel booking engine, and <a href="http://www.cropcholate.com">Crop Chocolate</a>, a &#8216;deal of the day&#8217; site which is focused on scrapbooking supplies.

<h3>Kudos</h3>

<p>
  &#8220;Working with Eric was like watching a genius at work. He is one of the most talented developers I have ever seen. He is great at putting his head down and cranking out amazing code. I often compare watching him work to watching Picasso or Van Gogh painting. His code is beautiful. He takes time to make sure his it is clean and elegant. Without hesitation I would recommend him to anyone.&#8221;&#8221;

<p>
  &#8220;Eric is amazing! He has been able to accomplish programming tasks in hours that previously took our company months - literally. He has the rare combination of know-how and the drive to finish projects completely. He remains focused and understands priorities. He is able to share his insights without changing or challenging the task at hand. I highly recommend him in every way (as long as he never stops working with us!).&#8221;

<p>
  &#8220;Eric is a development powerhouse. He has a rare blend of core strengths in both halves of his brain. He possesses great creativity and design savvy as well as stellar programming ability. I know that any firm could be successful if it could fill itself with guys like Eric.&#8221;

<p>
  &#8220;If we wanted something done right, we went to Eric. His depth of experience allowed us to choose the best solution to any issue. His ability to get things done was a huge asset to the sales team.&#8221;
