### Kudos

<p>
  "Working with Eric was like watching a genius at work. He is one of the most talented developers I have ever seen. He is great at putting his head down and cranking out amazing code. I often compare watching him work to watching Picasso or Van Gogh painting. His code is beautiful. He takes time to make sure his it is clean and elegant. Without hesitation I would recommend him to anyone.""

  "Eric is amazing! He has been able to accomplish programming tasks in hours that previously took our company months - literally. He has the rare combination of know-how and the drive to finish projects completely. He remains focused and understands priorities. He is able to share his insights without changing or challenging the task at hand. I highly recommend him in every way (as long as he never stops working with us!)."
