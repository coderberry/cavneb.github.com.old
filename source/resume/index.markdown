### Summary

With over 15 years of software engineering experience, I have been able to focus on learning as much about agile web develelopment, specializing in technologies such as **Ruby on Rails**, **Grails**, **JavaScript** and **front-end development**. I *LOVE* TDD and testing as well.

I was a co-founder of ShareAPhoto, Ltd which was [acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2006](http://h20338.www2.hp.com/enterprise/cache/504712-0-0-225-121.html). I was the author of [Rails Pocket Reference (published 2008 – O’Reilly)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596520717.do). I spear-headed [TeachMeToCode.com](http://teachmetocode.com/), a popular on-demand screencasting website dedicated to helping others learn how to program, which includes a popular series on [writing a Twitter clone with Rails](http://teachmetocode.com/screencasts/creating-a-twitter-clone-in-rails-part-1/). 

I designed and developed enterprise solutions such as [Reservation Counter](http://www.reservationcounter.com/), an online hotel booking engine, and [Crop Chocolate](http://www.cropcholate.com), a 'deal of the day' site which is focused on scrapbooking supplies. I also dabbled in mobile development for iOS, [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Berry+Mobile) and [Palm](https://developer.palm.com/appredirect/?packageid=com.berry.wendywwpro).

I am an avid [contributor](https://github.com/cavneb) to open source software. I enjoyed spending time working alongside the creators of the [Grails](http://grails.org) framework with the [redesign and implementation](http://grails.org/news/1285414) of the Grails.org website. This includes parts which cannot be seen, such as the backend admin/approval system.

### Portfolio (just a few of them)

[Facebook Sweepstakes](http://apps.facebook.com/hooplasoft_giveaways/board) is a Facebook application that has become a pet project. It is a community of 'sweekstalkers' who enter giveaway after giveaway. I built the software in Rails/MySQL. There are currently over 70,000 unique monthly users to date.

[Reservation Counter](http://www.reservationcounter.com) is a low-fare hotel reservation application which ties in with the Expedia.com affiliate interface. I assisted in the design and built it with Rails/MySQL.

[Crop Chocolate](http://www.cropchocolate.com) is a 'deal of the day' website for the scrapbooker. This application includes a full cart system with checkout, merchant account integration, logistics integration, extensive reporting and much more. I was provided the photoshop artwork and built the site front and back with Rails/MySQL.

[FloBridge](http://www.flobridge.com) is a direct lender for short-term payday loans that needed a site for developing its own leads. If the lead does not qualify via FloBridge, they are re-sold to a buyer tree. I wrote this using Rails/MySQL.

### Kudos

<p>
  Working with Eric was like watching a genius at work. He is one of the most talented developers I have ever seen. He is great at putting his head down and cranking out amazing code. I often compare watching him work to watching Picasso or Van Gogh painting. His code is beautiful. He takes time to make sure his it is clean and elegant. Without hesitation I would recommend him to anyone.

  Eric is amazing! He has been able to accomplish programming tasks in hours that previously took our company months - literally. He has the rare combination of know-how and the drive to finish projects completely. He remains focused and understands priorities. He is able to share his insights without changing or challenging the task at hand. I highly recommend him in every way (as long as he never stops working with us!).

  Eric is a development powerhouse. He has a rare blend of core strengths in both halves of his brain. He possesses great creativity and design savvy as well as stellar programming ability. I know that any firm could be successful if it could fill itself with guys like Eric.

  If we wanted something done right, we went to Eric. His depth of experience allowed us to choose the best solution to any issue. His ability to get things done was a huge asset to the sales team.
